# About this project

## Use Case
The provided integration allows you to easily send an event to the Optimizely Full Stack results page. Using the Optimizely Full Stack Javascript SDK, in conjunction with an Optimizely X Web TrackEvent listener, it's possible to send a Full Stack event each time the X Web client tracks an event.

## Project Contents
* `extension.json`: A custom analytics integration for Optimizely X web that uses front-end instance of Full Stack to send an equivalent Full Stack event whenever X Web tracks an event.
* `app.js`: A simple node webserver, built with expressjs, that serves a test page with a Full Stack user ID cookie. This cookie is utilized by the Full Stack integration to ensure that front end events are properly attributed to full stack experiments

# How to use
*note:* Complete the "running the test site" steps before the "using the integration" steps.

## Running the test site
* `git clone` this repo
* run `npm install`
* change the snippet in `index.html` to a personal project
* update `datafile.json` with the contents of your own full stack datafile
* run `node app.js` in the terminal

## Using the extension
* Create a new analytics integration from JSON, using the contents of `extension.json`:
